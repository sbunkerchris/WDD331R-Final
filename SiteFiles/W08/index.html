        <h2>Lighthouse</h2>

    <p>from tool it identifies that performace(speed) of this site is low. It suggests using image types that have faster load times and smaller image file sizes (doesnt list this but its a logical option). Additionally it suggests using less javascript that defers loading.</p>
    <p>these were the first two and most major sugested fixes.</p>
    <p>Lighthouse as an add-on I see as a great resouce that can quickly check your website for overlooked improvements. The hardest part for me currently is knowing what they are talking about. I had to look up a few comon used words and phrases. This may be more due to my inexperience but still a great option for quickly finding areas of improvement for your website.</p>

        <h2>Chrome Performance Monitor</h2>
        <p>This tool is great for looking at real time information. JS heap size, CPU usage etc. The visualization of this data is great for seeing at what points in time and on what pages strain web browsers.</p>
